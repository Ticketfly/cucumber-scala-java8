Port of cucumber-scala dsl. https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/tree/master/scala

The DSL is same as cucumber-scala, but this uses the JavaBackend instead of ScalaBackend used by the official plugin. 

This plugin also supports Dependency Injection where the official plugin does not support DI.
